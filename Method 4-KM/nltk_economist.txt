Dr. Marcus is founding Director of the Program for Health Care Negotiation and Conflict Resolution at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Nationally and internationally, he is recognized as a pioneer and leading voice in the evolving field of negotiation, conflict resolution, and meta-leadership as it pertains to a wide range of issues and practical applications in health care.

Dr. Marcus is lead author of the primary text in the field, Renegotiating Health Care: Resolving Conflict to Build Collaboration that was recently released in Second Edition (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers). The book in its First Edition was selected as co-recipient of the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolution 1995 “Book Prize Award for Excellence in Alternative Dispute Resolution”. It also won the Book of the Year award from the Journal of the American Nursing Association. He co-authored with Nancy Dubler, Mediating Bioethical Disputes: A Practical Guide.

Dr. Marcus has directed numerous projects and authored papers intended to advance development of the leadership, negotiation, collaborative problem solving, and conflict resolution field applied to health related issues. He collaborated with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine to develop the Voluntary Mediation Program, the first initiative of its kind to mediate medical practice disputes directly between patients and physicians.

Dr. Marcus has developed a number of practical applications of mediation and conflict resolution. His has lectured in the Middle East, Europe, India, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Dr. Marcus was among a number of academics across the country asked to assist in advancing national preparedness and response. Dr. Marcus is founding Co-Director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, a joint program of Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. In recent years, Dr. Marcus’ research, teaching, and consultation have played a key role in national and international terrorism and emergency preparedness and response. He has pioneered development of the conceptual and pragmatic basis for “meta-leadership”- “overarching leadership that strategically links the work of different agencies and levels of government.”

Recent research activities have taken him to the center of emergency preparedness and response through direct observation and immediate interviews with leadership during the early H1N1 response, the 2009 Presidential Inauguration, the 2009 and 2006 wars in Israel, the 2010 BP oil spill, and in 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. At the invitation of the President’s Advisor on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, he lectured at the White House on meta-leadership to a cross section of senior federal department officials from across the government. Along with colleagues at the NPLI, he is researching the leadership response to the Boston Marathon bombings.

Dr. Marcus completed his doctoral work at The Heller School of Brandeis University. He was selected as a Fellow for the Kellogg National Leadership Program from 1986-1989. In his spare time he plays saxophone and clarinet, is a cartoonist, and loves to travel.

Dr. Marcus is founding Director of the Program for Health Care Negotiation and Conflict Resolution at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Nationally and internationally, he is recognized as a pioneer and leading voice in the evolving field of negotiation, conflict resolution, and meta-leadership as it pertains to a wide range of issues and practical applications in health care.

Dr. Marcus is lead author of the primary text in the field, Renegotiating Health Care: Resolving Conflict to Build Collaboration that was recently released in Second Edition (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers). The book in its First Edition was selected as co-recipient of the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolution 1995 “Book Prize Award for Excellence in Alternative Dispute Resolution”. It also won the Book of the Year award from the Journal of the American Nursing Association. He co-authored with Nancy Dubler, Mediating Bioethical Disputes: A Practical Guide.

Dr. Marcus has directed numerous projects and authored papers intended to advance development of the leadership, negotiation, collaborative problem solving, and conflict resolution field applied to health related issues. He collaborated with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine to develop the Voluntary Mediation Program, the first initiative of its kind to mediate medical practice disputes directly between patients and physicians.

Dr. Marcus has developed a number of practical applications of mediation and conflict resolution. His has lectured in the Middle East, Europe, India, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Dr. Marcus was among a number of academics across the country asked to assist in advancing national preparedness and response. Dr. Marcus is founding Co-Director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, a joint program of Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. In recent years, Dr. Marcus’ research, teaching, and consultation have played a key role in national and international terrorism and emergency preparedness and response. He has pioneered development of the conceptual and pragmatic basis for “meta-leadership”- “overarching leadership that strategically links the work of different agencies and levels of government.”

Recent research activities have taken him to the center of emergency preparedness and response through direct observation and immediate interviews with leadership during the early H1N1 response, the 2009 Presidential Inauguration, the 2009 and 2006 wars in Israel, the 2010 BP oil spill, and in 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. At the invitation of the President’s Advisor on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, he lectured at the White House on meta-leadership to a cross section of senior federal department officials from across the government. Along with colleagues at the NPLI, he is researching the leadership response to the Boston Marathon bombings.

Dr. Marcus completed his doctoral work at The Heller School of Brandeis University. He was selected as a Fellow for the Kellogg National Leadership Program from 1986-1989. In his spare time he plays saxophone and clarinet, is a cartoonist, and loves to travel.

Dr. Marcus is founding Co-Director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, a joint program of Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.

He has pioneered development of the conceptual and pragmatic basis for “meta-leadership”- “overarching leadership that strategically links the work of different agencies and levels of government.”

Recent research activities have taken him to the center of emergency preparedness and response through direct observation and immediate interviews with leadership during the early H1N1 response, the 2009 Presidential Inauguration, the 2009 and 2006 wars in Israel, the 2010 BP oil spill, and in 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. At the invitation of the President’s Advisor on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, he lectured at the White House on meta-leadership to a cross section of senior federal department officials from across the government. Along with colleagues at the NPLI, he is researching the leadership response to the Boston Marathon bombings.

Dr. Marcus completed his doctoral work at The Heller School of Brandeis University. He was selected as a Fellow for the Kellogg National Leadership Program from 1986-1989. In his spare time he plays saxophone and clarinet, is a cartoonist, and loves to travel.
