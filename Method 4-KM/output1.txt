• An alternative narrative on Khashoggi.

President Trump, after speaking with the king of Saudi Arabia, offered a new take on what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi: “Rogue killers” might be behind his disappearance.

Turkish officials have said he was killed by Saudi agents. But the president’s words opened a window for Saudi Arabia to stand by its denials.

(Neither Turkey nor Saudi Arabia have shared evidence so far. Here’s what else we don’t know yet. And here’s a portrait of Mr. Khashoggi’s career.)

I do not think it’s a turning point, unfortunately. The climate in America is toxic. Oftentimes “they” feel threatened, although in most cases we are unarmed and are not a threat to anyone. Time and again the officer’s behavior is deemed justified. It is my opinion, if “they” are generally so afraid of us, perhaps another line of employment would be advisable.

— Beverly Macon

I certainly hope that this is a turning point but I sincerely doubt it. Racism runs deep in this country and it isn’t going away. I think it will take at least 50 years for things to change. I thank God every night that my son is white. I cannot imagine what it must be like for the mothers of black boys.

— Lynn Godmilow

As a former state prosecutor and an old white man, I think the verdict was completely justified. The shooting was an outrage under the circumstances. Van Dyke deserves a very long prison sentence. He is an unapologetic killer.

— Richard Altman

The verdict is just an aberration. It took four years and an extraordinary amount of public pressure and a video just to get this verdict. The law enforcement community will double down, correct their mistakes in Van Dyke’s defense and reinforce the blue wall of silence and complicity that permeates the criminal justice system from top to bottom.

WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia was preparing an alternative explanation of the fate of a dissident journalist on Monday, saying he died at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago in an interrogation gone wrong, according to a person familiar with the kingdom’s plans. In Washington, President Trump echoed the possibility that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of “rogue killers.”

The shifting story line defied earlier details that have emerged in the case, including signs that he was murdered and dismembered. Among other things, Turkish officials have said, an autopsy specialist carrying a bone saw was among 15 Saudi operatives who flew in and out of Istanbul the day Mr. Khashoggi disappeared.

The new explanation, whatever its truth, seemed intended to ease the political crisis that Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance has created for Saudi Arabia. The new story could also defuse some criticism of the Trump administration, which has refused to back down from billions of dollars in weapons sales to the kingdom and as of Monday was still planning to attend a glittering Saudi investment forum next week.

And it could help Turkey, where a shaky economy would benefit from a financial infusion that low-interest loans from Riyadh could provide.

WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia was preparing an alternative explanation of the fate of a dissident journalist on Monday, saying he died at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago in an interrogation gone wrong, according to a person familiar with the kingdom’s plans. In Washington, President Trump echoed the possibility that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of “rogue killers.”

The shifting story line defied earlier details that have emerged in the case, including signs that he was murdered and dismembered. Among other things, Turkish officials have said, an autopsy specialist carrying a bone saw was among 15 Saudi operatives who flew in and out of Istanbul the day Mr. Khashoggi disappeared.

The new explanation, whatever its truth, seemed intended to ease the political crisis that Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance has created for Saudi Arabia. The new story could also defuse some criticism of the Trump administration, which has refused to back down from billions of dollars in weapons sales to the kingdom and as of Monday was still planning to attend a glittering Saudi investment forum next week.

And it could help Turkey, where a shaky economy would benefit from a financial infusion that low-interest loans from Riyadh could provide.

The disappearance of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi has set off a diplomatic feud between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, a bipartisan uproar in the United States Congress, tremors of uncertainty in Wall Street and Silicon Valley about how to deal with Saudi Arabia, and a noisy spat between the White House and its closest Arab ally.

On Monday morning, President Trump said on Twitter that he had just discussed the case with King Salman, who denied any knowledge of what had happened to Mr. Khashoggi, and that he was “immediately sending” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with the king. Later, in brief remarks to reporters, he said that from his conversation with the king, “it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers — who knows.”

American officials have speculated that if Saudi Arabia confirms suspicions that Mr. Khashoggi was killed, it would propose that rogue elements acted on their own, not under orders from the highest levels of power in the kingdom. Turkish officials have described a grisly assassination and cover-up, with Saudi agents dismembering the body for disposal.

Turkish news organizations reported on Monday that Saudi Arabia would open its consulate to a search by investigators from both countries — something the kingdom has promised before but not yet allowed. And King Salman of Saudi Arabia reportedly ordered Saudi prosecutors to open their own investigation.

WASHINGTON — The disappearance of a Saudi dissident journalist has put Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, in an increasingly tenuous position as he prepares to attend an investment conference in Riyadh next week.

Several top Wall Street executives have pulled out of the meeting, but as of Monday, Mr. Mnuchin still planned to attend. President Trump, speaking at an event in Georgia, said Mr. Mnuchin would make a final decision on whether to participate by Friday.

The Treasury secretary’s attendance at the investment conference is part of a weeklong, six-country swing through the Middle East that is focused on combating terrorist financing. The trip is crucial to retaining good relations with Saudi Arabia as both countries try to work together to stem illicit financial activities in the Middle East. But Mr. Mnuchin is now wrestling with the ramifications of remaining in the Saudi government’s good stead amid questions about the fate of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.

Mr. Khashoggi has not been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The Turkish authorities have alleged that Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi operatives.

LYNN HAVEN, Fla. — In what has become a recurring ritual of the fall, President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, traveled here on Monday to survey the destruction of another hurricane, this one named Michael, which last week laid waste to the Florida Panhandle.

“This was beyond any winds we’ve seen for — I guess — 50 years,” Mr. Trump said, before he and Mrs. Trump handed out plastic water bottles to storm victims at an aid distribution center in this hard-hit town. “They say that 50 years ago, there was one that had this kind of power.”

“Fifty years,” he added. “It’s a long time.”

Even for a president who has now seen five hurricanes — including Harvey, which swamped Houston; Maria, which destroyed Puerto Rico; and Florence, which inundated the Carolinas — Michael left a particularly spectacular trail of wreckage along the Florida Gulf Coast.

Pine trees were uprooted and splintered — one lying across a Chevrolet sedan, others bisecting houses. Roofs had been torn off row after row of houses, blue tarps strung across the yawning holes. Windows were shattered, and even the wood siding was peeled off.

Pine trees were uprooted and splintered — one lying across a Chevrolet sedan, others bisecting houses. Roofs had been torn off row after row of houses, blue tarps strung across the yawning holes. Windows were shattered, and even the wood siding was peeled off.

LYNN HAVEN, Fla. — In what has become a recurring ritual of the fall, President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, traveled here on Monday to survey the destruction of another hurricane, this one named Michael, which last week laid waste to the Florida Panhandle.

“This was beyond any winds we’ve seen for — I guess — 50 years,” Mr. Trump said, before he and Mrs. Trump handed out plastic water bottles to storm victims at an aid distribution center in this hard-hit town. “They say that 50 years ago, there was one that had this kind of power.”

Florida’s building code, put into effect in 2002, is famously stringent when it comes to windstorm resistance for homes built along the hurricane-prone Atlantic shoreline. But it is less so for structures along the Panhandle, a region historically unaffected by storms as strong as the ones that have slammed into South Florida.

After Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 beast, ravaged Miami-Dade County in 1992, new construction in the southern portion of the state was required to withstand 175-mile-an-hour winds. In the coastal Panhandle counties affected by Michael, the requirement is lower, for 120 to 150 miles an hour, and the rules for certain kinds of reinforcement have applied to houses built more than a mile from shore only since 2007. Many of the residences and businesses rubbed out by Michael in Mexico Beach were far older; rebuilding them to conform to the new code will be expensive, and could price out some of the working-class people who historically have flocked to Mexico Beach.

Mr. King wouldn’t say how much he and Dr. Lackey spent to fortify the beachside home, which public records show has been assessed for tax purposes at a value of $400,000. Their architect, Charles A. Gaskin, said that building a house the way they did roughly doubles the cost per square foot, compared with ordinary building practices.

Other experts had different views of the expense required. An estimate published in Forbes in 2012 said implementing an array of storm-resistance measures, including some of those advised by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, would add more than $30,000 to the cost of a typical house.

“Every time something like this happens, you have to say to yourself, ‘Is there something we can do better?’” Gov. Rick Scott told reporters, as public officials were called upon once again to examine the state’s building standards.

PANAMA CITY, Fla. — With much of the area struck by Hurricane Michael without power or running water, residents here are adjusting to a new feature of daily life: the line.

People wait for hours to buy essentials or to receive aid. In the Florida heat, food is spoiling quickly, so residents clamor for ice. Bottled water is a must. And gasoline, which people need to track down these supplies, is becoming increasingly scarce.

In the days since the storm hit on Oct. 10, The New York Times talked to some of the people waiting in the many lines now scattered throughout the region.

“Before the storm, I ordered twice as much food as I normally do. I’ve been cooking since daylight. Comfort is the most important thing right now.”

Cassidy Nelson, Lynn Haven, Fla.

On Saturday, Harold Sherman and his brother Clayton delivered two trailers carrying 75,000 pounds of bagged and unbagged ice from Baldwin County, Ala., to Southport, Fla. Joe Ward/The New York Times

“I live in an RV park that almost sustained a total loss. We have no power or water and I have to stock up at least every other day. I am helping a couple of other households because I have a van and I am able to get out. We need to keep food preserved.”

Shawn Perry, Southport, Fla.

At a Salvation Army distribution center in Panama City Beach, Fla., on Sunday, hot meals, water, snacks and pet food were among the essentials available to hurricane victims. Joe Ward/The New York Times

“It’s the only warm meal that my kids get right now. I have three dogs that are stuck on my back porch. I don’t have the means to buy food right now for them, so knowing that they have it here takes a little stress off me.”

Anita Boykin, Lynn Haven, Fla.

Traffic on Sunday was backed up for miles on Route 98 heading out of Panama City. Many drivers, if not most, were searching for gasoline. Bedel Saget/The New York Times

“We’re heading to Panama City Beach to get gas. We came over to check on my granddaughter and I didn’t know there were no stations open in this area.”

Murline Kirkland, Panama City Beach, Fla.

Gary Jones, the owner of this gas station on Route 77 in Southport, said that the terminals where stations get their gas are without power and unable to pump, contributing to the shortage. Bedel Saget/The New York Times

Gary Jones, Freeport, Fla.

Sam’s Club was one of the few places in Panama City that was selling gas on Sunday. Bedel Saget/The New York Times

PANAMA CITY, Fla. — With much of the area struck by Hurricane Michael without power or running water, residents here are adjusting to a new feature of daily life: the line.

People wait for hours to buy essentials or to receive aid. In the Florida heat, food is spoiling quickly, so residents clamor for ice. Bottled water is a must. And gasoline, which people need to track down these supplies, is becoming increasingly scarce.

Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft who helped usher in the personal computing revolution and then channeled his enormous fortune into transforming Seattle into a cultural destination, died on Monday in Seattle. He was 65.

The cause was complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, his family said in a statement.

The disease recurred recently after having been in remission for years. He left Microsoft in the early 1980s, after the cancer first appeared, and, using his enormous wealth, went on to make a powerful impact on Seattle life through his philanthropy and his ownership of the N.F.L. team there, ensuring that it would remain in the city.

Mr. Allen was a force at Microsoft during its first seven years, along with its co-founder, Bill Gates, as the personal computer was moving from a hobbyist curiosity to a mainstream technology, used by both businesses and consumers.

When the company was founded, in 1975, the machines were known as microcomputers, to distinguish the desktop computers from the hulking machines of the day. Mr. Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, an apt one for a company that made software for small computers. The term personal computer would become commonplace later.

Mr. Allen was a force at Microsoft during its first seven years, along with its co-founder, Bill Gates, as the personal computer was moving from a hobbyist curiosity to a mainstream technology, used by both businesses and consumers.

When the company was founded, in 1975, the machines were known as microcomputers, to distinguish the desktop computers from the hulking machines of the day. Mr. Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, an apt one for a company that made software for small computers. The term personal computer would become commonplace later.

Allen, 62, may be one of the least visible N.F.L. owners, but he remains committed to the Seahawks, who fell short in their attempt to become the first team in a decade to win consecutive Super Bowl titles, with a 28-24 loss to the Patriots on Sunday. Although he may say little publicly, Allen is basking in his team’s success.

“You kind of grow into it, and the more you know the players and coaches, you can feel the enthusiasm of the fans, you are just as engaged, if not more so,” Allen said in an interview Saturday on the field at University of Phoenix Stadium. “This year was one of those years where we’ve had some ups and downs and challenges that were unexpected, but that’s part of sports.”

Allen’s inner fan is evident. At last year’s Super Bowl, which the Seahawks won, 43-8, he sat with General Manager John Schneider, who elbowed him nervously each time the Seahawks made a good play, as if they could not believe their good fortune.

At the N.F.C. championship game against the Green Bay Packers two weeks ago, Allen recounted how he tried to calculate the chances of the Seahawks winning after they scored on a fake punt for their first points. He did it again before the team recovered an onside kick that changed the momentum of the game.

“I’m always trying to calculate the mathematical probability of certain outcomes,” said Allen, who founded Microsoft along with Bill Gates . “I even did it during last year’s Super Bowl. We were up by 20-plus points, but there is a chance of them coming back because they are a high-powered offense. I’m always doing that; it’s just the way my mind works.”

Allen, who wore a Seahawks cap and ski jacket, declined to predict the outcome of Sunday’s game during a half-hour interview Saturday. But it is evident that his mind works in a multitude of other ways. Though he was happy to discuss the Seahawks or his other team, the Portland Trail Blazers , he segued from sports to his love of Jimi Hendrix to his interest in the biochemistry of the brain to fighting the Ebola virus.

Slide Show

With a fortune worth an estimated $17 billion, Allen has the wherewithal to think big. In the fall, he committed $100 million to the fight against Ebola. More than half of the money has been spent on things like protection suits for health care workers, evacuation units that can be used on planes and cellphones with preloaded software so doctors can better track the disease.

“What I try to do is see the landscape out there, what is going on and where I think I can make a difference,” Allen said. “The minute that outbreak started, I just thought there was something different about this outbreak, it seems to be spreading more rapidly than other outbreaks. And once it really got going, as you know the momentum of these things, if you don’t jump on it, the nightmare was that we would be looking at millions of cases.”

Although Allen leaves much of the day-to-day business of the Seahawks and the Trail Blazers to a phalanx of executives and rarely attends owners meetings, he does follow the issues that affect these sports, including domestic violence.

Rather than endorse or criticize the N.F.L. commissioner directly, Allen spoke broadly about the issue, which plunged the league into crisis this season. After video was published showing the former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his fiancée, Allen said, it was “important for me to raise my consciousness.” He watched movies about domestic violence and spoke to psychologists about how to deal with the problem.

Without being specific, Allen said he was trying to create a counseling program for the players and their families that the Seahawks and potentially all teams could use.

Allen is also searching for ways to minimize and treat concussions , another plague on the league. That includes developing different helmet designs to minimize impacts on the brain.

“The game is very intense, so you’re never going to have zero concussions, but then you’re never going to have zero concussions in any sport,” Allen said. “But this sport is very intense.”

Allen’s brain institute in Seattle is taking a far broader view. In addition to trying to map the genetics of the brain, the scientists there want to tackle the fundamental science of how the brain works. For good measure, Allen opened a cell biology institute to determine how cells work. In time, the research could help scientists understand diseases, develop drugs and determine why some people get sick and others do not.

“All of these are decadal innovations,” he said. “They are not things that will be ready in five years, but if they make a difference in 10, 20 years from now, that’s what you hope for.”

Of more immediate concern, of course, was how the Seahawks would play on Sunday. The Patriots, he said, have a Hall of Fame quarterback and coach and a stout defense that should not be taken for granted.

Allen’s caution proved correct, which is why he is unlikely to repeat last year’s celebration party, when he broke out his guitar and jammed with his band. He now has a custom-built amplifier he ordered with volume controls that go to 12, an homage to the team’s fans, who are known as the 12th Man.

“You can’t use it all the time, just on important occasions,” Allen said Saturday. “The fans have just been unbelievable, both last year and this year, and even before, and it will be interesting to see tomorrow.”

“You kind of grow into it, and the more you know the players and coaches, you can feel the enthusiasm of the fans, you are just as engaged, if not more so,” Allen said in an interview Saturday on the field at University of Phoenix Stadium. “This year was one of those years where we’ve had some ups and downs and challenges that were unexpected, but that’s part of sports.”

Allen’s inner fan is evident. At last year’s Super Bowl, which the Seahawks won, 43-8, he sat with General Manager John Schneider, who elbowed him nervously each time the Seahawks made a good play, as if they could not believe their good fortune.

At the N.F.C. championship game against the Green Bay Packers two weeks ago, Allen recounted how he tried to calculate the chances of the Seahawks winning after they scored on a fake punt for their first points. He did it again before the team recovered an onside kick that changed the momentum of the game.

“I’m always trying to calculate the mathematical probability of certain outcomes,” said Allen, who founded Microsoft along with Bill Gates . “I even did it during last year’s Super Bowl. We were up by 20-plus points, but there is a chance of them coming back because they are a high-powered offense. I’m always doing that; it’s just the way my mind works.”

Allen, who wore a Seahawks cap and ski jacket, declined to predict the outcome of Sunday’s game during a half-hour interview Saturday. But it is evident that his mind works in a multitude of other ways. Though he was happy to discuss the Seahawks or his other team, the Portland Trail Blazers , he segued from sports to his love of Jimi Hendrix to his interest in the biochemistry of the brain to fighting the Ebola virus.

With a fortune worth an estimated $17 billion, Allen has the wherewithal to think big. In the fall, he committed $100 million to the fight against Ebola. More than half of the money has been spent on things like protection suits for health care workers, evacuation units that can be used on planes and cellphones with preloaded software so doctors can better track the disease.

“What I try to do is see the landscape out there, what is going on and where I think I can make a difference,” Allen said. “The minute that outbreak started, I just thought there was something different about this outbreak, it seems to be spreading more rapidly than other outbreaks. And once it really got going, as you know the momentum of these things, if you don’t jump on it, the nightmare was that we would be looking at millions of cases.”

Although Allen leaves much of the day-to-day business of the Seahawks and the Trail Blazers to a phalanx of executives and rarely attends owners meetings, he does follow the issues that affect these sports, including domestic violence.

Rather than endorse or criticize the N.F.L. commissioner directly, Allen spoke broadly about the issue, which plunged the league into crisis this season. After video was published showing the former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his fiancée, Allen said, it was “important for me to raise my consciousness.” He watched movies about domestic violence and spoke to psychologists about how to deal with the problem.

Without being specific, Allen said he was trying to create a counseling program for the players and their families that the Seahawks and potentially all teams could use.

Allen is also searching for ways to minimize and treat concussions , another plague on the league. That includes developing different helmet designs to minimize impacts on the brain.

“The game is very intense, so you’re never going to have zero concussions, but then you’re never going to have zero concussions in any sport,” Allen said. “But this sport is very intense.”

Allen’s brain institute in Seattle is taking a far broader view. In addition to trying to map the genetics of the brain, the scientists there want to tackle the fundamental science of how the brain works. For good measure, Allen opened a cell biology institute to determine how cells work. In time, the research could help scientists understand diseases, develop drugs and determine why some people get sick and others do not.

“All of these are decadal innovations,” he said. “They are not things that will be ready in five years, but if they make a difference in 10, 20 years from now, that’s what you hope for.”

Of more immediate concern, of course, was how the Seahawks would play on Sunday. The Patriots, he said, have a Hall of Fame quarterback and coach and a stout defense that should not be taken for granted.

Allen’s caution proved correct, which is why he is unlikely to repeat last year’s celebration party, when he broke out his guitar and jammed with his band. He now has a custom-built amplifier he ordered with volume controls that go to 12, an homage to the team’s fans, who are known as the 12th Man.

“You can’t use it all the time, just on important occasions,” Allen said Saturday. “The fans have just been unbelievable, both last year and this year, and even before, and it will be interesting to see tomorrow.”

In time, the research could help scientists understand diseases, develop drugs and determine why some people get sick and others do not.

“All of these are decadal innovations,” he said. “They are not things that will be ready in five years, but if they make a difference in 10, 20 years from now, that’s what you hope for.”

Of more immediate concern, of course, was how the Seahawks would play on Sunday. The Patriots, he said, have a Hall of Fame quarterback and coach and a stout defense that should not be taken for granted.

Allen’s caution proved correct, which is why he is unlikely to repeat last year’s celebration party, when he broke out his guitar and jammed with his band. He now has a custom-built amplifier he ordered with volume controls that go to 12, an homage to the team’s fans, who are known as the 12th Man.

“You can’t use it all the time, just on important occasions,” Allen said Saturday. “The fans have just been unbelievable, both last year and this year, and even before, and it will be interesting to see tomorrow.”

WASHINGTON — Democratic candidates are outpacing the fund-raising of their Republican rivals in key congressional races, but huge checks from conservatives assured that their side will remain financially competitive in the weeks before next month’s midterms.

In an election season that appears likely to shatter midterm fund-raising records, Democrats outraised their Republican opponents in 32 of the closest 45 House races by a total margin of $154 million to $108 million since November 2016, according to an analysis of reports filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission. Even in the 13 targeted races in which Republicans outraised their Democratic rivals, the margin was a less gaping $41 million to $31 million.

The breakneck Democratic campaign fund-raising, much of which was fueled by donors giving small sums online, has boosted the confidence of party leaders. They believe the financial advantage will give them the resources they need to harness an enthusiasm gap and capitalize on enmity for President Trump headed into Election Day.

To take the majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats need to flip at least 23 seats currently held by Republicans. For Democrats to win control of the Senate, a more difficult task, they would have to defend 26 seats — including 10 in states won by President Trump in 2016 — and flip two of the five Republican seats considered in play.

But Mr. Ellison’s campaign has been consumed with Ms. Monahan’s allegations.

Mr. Ellison said the final stages of the relationship had been marked by frequent arguments but said he was stunned by Ms. Monahan’s abuse allegations and her recent emergence as a cause célèbre of the Republican Party. “I think the question to be asked is, ‘What is her ultimate goal?’” he said. “If her goal is to frustrate my political future, maybe she’ll ally with anyone who can help her achieve that.”

Ms. Monahan has said on Twitter, “I didn’t #WalkAwayFromDemocrats, they #WalkedAway from me.”

Mr. Ellison’s inner circle has been divided over how to respond to allegations, which Ms. Monahan has been alluding to on Twitter and Facebook — without naming him — since the couple’s tumultuous breakup. Some advocated a vigorous defense, while others saw nothing to be gained by talking about her claims.

Friends of the couple have described the relationship as rocky, with Ms. Monahan often accusing Mr. Ellison of infidelity. Even after they separated and she moved out of his house, Ms. Monahan continued trying to prove that he had been unfaithful to her, he said.

Ms. Monahan visited him in January 2017 and searched his phone without his permission, obtaining screenshots of text messages that he had sent to two other women. She also left a handwritten journal at his house that insulted one of the women he had started dating, calling her “old.” Ms. Monahan later wrote the woman a letter accusing the woman of stealing Mr. Ellison’s affections.

Mr. Ellison said he had tried to strike a conciliatory tone with Ms. Monahan. She sent him videos, articles and texts about “narcissist abuse,” a nonmedical term that has gained popularity online to describe the pain experienced by partners of pathologically self-centered people. And she asked him to discuss the articles with her, saying that she wanted to help him and that she also wanted “restorative justice.”

Ms. Monahan visited him in January 2017 and searched his phone without his permission, obtaining screenshots of text messages that he had sent to two other women. She also left a handwritten journal at his house that insulted one of the women he had started dating, calling her “old.” Ms. Monahan later wrote the woman a letter accusing the woman of stealing Mr. Ellison’s affections.

Mr. Ellison said he had tried to strike a conciliatory tone with Ms. Monahan. She sent him videos, articles and texts about “narcissist abuse,” a nonmedical term that has gained popularity online to describe the pain experienced by partners of pathologically self-centered people. And she asked him to discuss the articles with her, saying that she wanted to help him and that she also wanted “restorative justice.”

But Mr. Ellison’s campaign has been consumed with Ms. Monahan’s allegations.

Mr. Ellison said the final stages of the relationship had been marked by frequent arguments but said he was stunned by Ms. Monahan’s abuse allegations and her recent emergence as a cause célèbre of the Republican Party. “I think the question to be asked is, ‘What is her ultimate goal?’” he said. “If her goal is to frustrate my political future, maybe she’ll ally with anyone who can help her achieve that.”

Ms. Monahan has said on Twitter, “I didn’t #WalkAwayFromDemocrats, they #WalkedAway from me.”

Mr. Ellison’s inner circle has been divided over how to respond to allegations, which Ms. Monahan has been alluding to on Twitter and Facebook — without naming him — since the couple’s tumultuous breakup. Some advocated a vigorous defense, while others saw nothing to be gained by talking about her claims.

ATLANTA — Reports that tens of thousands of Georgia voters, predominantly African-Americans, were placed on a list for further scrutiny have exploded into the Georgia governor’s race, leading to bitter exchanges between the candidates and leaving many residents uncertain what to expect as the state began early voting Monday.

The uproar over voting seems almost an inevitable development in the race, which pits two candidates on opposite sides of the nation’s voting wars who have battled with one another over access to the polls for years.

Stacey Abrams, the Democrat, who is hoping to be the nation’s first black female governor, forged her political profile through a group she founded that in the last five years has registered thousands of new minority voters. Her opponent Brian Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state since 2010, has advanced strict voting rules that he says are needed to combat fraud, but which critics call a form of voter suppression directed at precisely the new voters Ms. Abrams is aiming to bring to the polls.

Their race is the latest example of how contentious and far-reaching voting issues have become in American politics, where once largely nonpartisan issues have been weaponized to gain an edge.

Response rates are extremely low nowadays, and our samples, at 500 per poll, are pretty small. Some of our poll results would have been 10 points different without the ability to weight by party registration or primary vote history, and occasionally even more than 10 points different. (Weighting means giving more weight to respondents from an underrepresented group to ensure the sample reflects the demographic profile of likely voters.) In almost all of these cases, it’s Democrats who have been overrepresented, not Republicans.

Based on that, and as we wrote at the time, we decided in September to largely avoid districts without party registration or primary vote history, including some places we’d really like to poll, like Montana or Minnesota’s First and Seventh Districts. For the same reason, we also considered not re-polling Minnesota’s Eighth.

It would be foolish to rule out the possibility that this poll result would have been 10 points different if we could have weighted by party registration, given that we know it has had that kind of effect in other districts. One could find additional evidence for this case by looking at President Trump’s approval rating and the party identification of the poll, two measures that lurched far to the right even though we don’t have much reason to believe that either ought to have moved so far.

It should be noted that this problem isn’t limited to us. A lot of pollsters going without party registration will occasionally get weird results like this. To compensate, some try to weight to party identification — whether people consider themselves Democrats or Republicans.

The challenge of weighting by party identification is that it’s hard to know the “real” party identification. That’s especially true in a congressional district where we’ve done only one poll before (typically, a firm weighting by party identification will choose to weight to the average result over several previous polls of the same area).

If we had weighted to the party identification from our September poll (in which we had Democrats outnumbering Republicans by two percentage points) or the average of the two polls (R+4), the results in this survey would indeed have moved to the left.

Mr. Stauber would have led by nine points if we had weighted to the average party identification of the two polls together. He would have led by four points if we had weighted to the party identification from September.

It would be foolish to rule out the possibility that this poll result would have been 10 points different if we could have weighted by party registration, given that we know it has had that kind of effect in other districts. One could find additional evidence for this case by looking at President Trump’s approval rating and the party identification of the poll, two measures that lurched far to the right even though we don’t have much reason to believe that either ought to have moved so far.

It should be noted that this problem isn’t limited to us. A lot of pollsters going without party registration will occasionally get weird results like this. To compensate, some try to weight to party identification — whether people consider themselves Democrats or Republicans.

The challenge of weighting by party identification is that it’s hard to know the “real” party identification. That’s especially true in a congressional district where we’ve done only one poll before (typically, a firm weighting by party identification will choose to weight to the average result over several previous polls of the same area).

If we had weighted to the party identification from our September poll (in which we had Democrats outnumbering Republicans by two percentage points) or the average of the two polls (R+4), the results in this survey would indeed have moved to the left.

Mr. Stauber would have led by nine points if we had weighted to the average party identification of the two polls together. He would have led by four points if we had weighted to the party identification from September.

Response rates are extremely low nowadays, and our samples, at 500 per poll, are pretty small. Some of our poll results would have been 10 points different without the ability to weight by party registration or primary vote history, and occasionally even more than 10 points different. (Weighting means giving more weight to respondents from an underrepresented group to ensure the sample reflects the demographic profile of likely voters.) In almost all of these cases, it’s Democrats who have been overrepresented, not Republicans.

Not while growing up as an orphan in his village near Lake Victoria where everybody was, like him, black. Not while studying at a university in another part of Kenya. Not until his job search led him to Ruiru, a fast-growing settlement at the edge of the capital, Nairobi, where Mr. Ochieng’ found work at a Chinese motorcycle company that had just expanded to Kenya.

But then his new boss, a Chinese man his own age, started calling him a monkey.

It happened when the two were on a sales trip and spotted a troop of baboons on the roadside, he said.

“‘Your brothers,’” he said his boss exclaimed, urging Mr. Ochieng’ to share some bananas with the primates.

President Trump, seeking to counter China’s growing geopolitical influence, is embracing a major expansion of foreign aid that will bankroll infrastructure projects in Africa, Asia and the Americas — throwing his support behind an initiative he once sought to scuttle.

With little fanfare, Mr. Trump signed a bill a little over a week ago that created a new foreign aid agency — the United States International Development Finance Corporation — and gave it authority to provide $60 billion in loans, loan guarantees and insurance to companies willing to do business in developing nations.

The move was a significant reversal for Mr. Trump, who has harshly criticized foreign aid from the opening moments of his presidential campaign in 2015. Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has proposed slashing $3 billion in overseas assistance, backed eliminating funding for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and taken steps to gut the United States Agency for International Development, the State Department agency that dispenses $22.7 billion a year in grants around the world.

The president’s shift has less to do with a sudden embrace of foreign aid than a desire to block Beijing’s plan for economic, technological and political dominance. China has spent nearly five years bankrolling a plan to gain greater global influence by financing big projects across Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.

The information superhighway cracks apart more easily when so much of it depends on privately owned infrastructure. An error at Amazon Web Services created losses of service across the web in 2017; a storm disrupting a data center in Northern Virginia created similar failures in 2012. These were unintentional blackouts; the corporate custodians of the internet have it within their power to do far more. Of course, nobody wants to turn off the internet completely — that wouldn’t make anyone money. But when a single company with huge market share chooses to comply with a law — or more worryingly, a mere suggestion from the authorities — a large chunk of the internet ends up falling in line.

The power of a handful of platforms and services combined with the dismal state of international cooperation across the world pushes us closer and closer to a splintered internet. Meanwhile, American companies that once implicitly pushed democratic values abroad are more reticent to take a stand.

In 2010, Google shut down its operations in China after it was revealed that the Chinese government had been hacking the Gmail accounts of dissidents and surveilling them through the search engine. “At some point you have to stand back and challenge this and say, this goes beyond the line of what we’re comfortable with, and adopt that for moral reasons,” said Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder, in an interview with Der Spiegel at the time.

But eight years later, Google is working on a search engine for China known as Dragonfly. Its launch will be conditional on the approval of Chinese officials and will therefore comply with stringent censorship requirements. An internal memo written by one of the engineers on the project described surveillance capabilities built into the engine — namely by requiring users to log in and then tracking their browsing histories. This data will be accessible by an unnamed Chinese partner, presumably the government.

Google says all features are speculative and no decision has been made on whether to launch Dragonfly, but a leaked transcript of a meeting inside Google later acquired by The Intercept, a news site, contradicts that line. In the transcript, Google’s head of search, Ben Gomes, is quoted as saying that it hoped to launch within six to nine months, although the unstable American-China relationship makes it difficult to predict when or even whether the Chinese government will give the go-ahead. “There is a huge binary difference between being launched and not launched,” said Mr. Gomes. “And so we want to be careful that we don’t miss that window if it ever comes.”

These were unintentional blackouts; the corporate custodians of the internet have it within their power to do far more. Of course, nobody wants to turn off the internet completely — that wouldn’t make anyone money. But when a single company with huge market share chooses to comply with a law — or more worryingly, a mere suggestion from the authorities — a large chunk of the internet ends up falling in line.

The power of a handful of platforms and services combined with the dismal state of international cooperation across the world pushes us closer and closer to a splintered internet. Meanwhile, American companies that once implicitly pushed democratic values abroad are more reticent to take a stand.

In 2010, Google shut down its operations in China after it was revealed that the Chinese government had been hacking the Gmail accounts of dissidents and surveilling them through the search engine. “At some point you have to stand back and challenge this and say, this goes beyond the line of what we’re comfortable with, and adopt that for moral reasons,” said Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder, in an interview with Der Spiegel at the time.

But eight years later, Google is working on a search engine for China known as Dragonfly. Its launch will be conditional on the approval of Chinese officials and will therefore comply with stringent censorship requirements. An internal memo written by one of the engineers on the project described surveillance capabilities built into the engine — namely by requiring users to log in and then tracking their browsing histories. This data will be accessible by an unnamed Chinese partner, presumably the government.

Google says all features are speculative and no decision has been made on whether to launch Dragonfly, but a leaked transcript of a meeting inside Google later acquired by The Intercept, a news site, contradicts that line. In the transcript, Google’s head of search, Ben Gomes, is quoted as saying that it hoped to launch within six to nine months, although the unstable American-China relationship makes it difficult to predict when or even whether the Chinese government will give the go-ahead. “There is a huge binary difference between being launched and not launched,” said Mr. Gomes. “And so we want to be careful that we don’t miss that window if it ever comes.”

NAGOYA, Japan — “Even a hunter cannot kill a bird that flies to him for refuge.” This Samurai maxim inspired one gifted and courageous man to save thousands of people in defiance of his government and at the cost of his career. On Friday I came to Nagoya at the invitation of the Japanese government to speak in honor of his memory.

The astonishing Chiune Sugihara raises again the questions: What shapes a moral hero? And how does someone choose to save people that others turn away?

Research on those who rescued Jews during the Holocaust shows that many exhibited a streak of independence from an early age. Sugihara was unconventional in a society known for prizing conformity. His father insisted that his son, a top student, become a doctor. But Sugihara wanted to study languages and travel and immerse himself in literature. Forced to sit for the medical exam, he left the entire answer sheet blank. The same willfulness was on display when he entered the diplomatic corps and, as vice minister of the Foreign Affairs Department for Japan in Manchuria in 1934, resigned in protest of the Japanese treatment of the Chinese.

A second characteristic of such heroes and heroines, as the psychologist Philip Zimbardo writes, is “that the very same situations that inflame the hostile imagination in some people, making them villains, can also instill the heroic imagination in other people, prompting them to perform heroic deeds.” While the world around him disregarded the plight of the Jews, Sugihara was unable to ignore their desperation.

On Friday I came to Nagoya at the invitation of the Japanese government to speak in honor of his memory.

The astonishing Chiune Sugihara raises again the questions: What shapes a moral hero? And how does someone choose to save people that others turn away?

Research on those who rescued Jews during the Holocaust shows that many exhibited a streak of independence from an early age. Sugihara was unconventional in a society known for prizing conformity. His father insisted that his son, a top student, become a doctor. But Sugihara wanted to study languages and travel and immerse himself in literature. Forced to sit for the medical exam, he left the entire answer sheet blank. The same willfulness was on display when he entered the diplomatic corps and, as vice minister of the Foreign Affairs Department for Japan in Manchuria in 1934, resigned in protest of the Japanese treatment of the Chinese.

A second characteristic of such heroes and heroines, as the psychologist Philip Zimbardo writes, is “that the very same situations that inflame the hostile imagination in some people, making them villains, can also instill the heroic imagination in other people, prompting them to perform heroic deeds.” While the world around him disregarded the plight of the Jews, Sugihara was unable to ignore their desperation.

Climate change is a hoax.

Climate change is happening, but it’s not man-made.

Climate change is man-made, but doing anything about it would destroy jobs and kill economic growth.

These are the stages of climate denial. Or maybe it’s wrong to call them stages, since the deniers never really give up an argument, no matter how thoroughly it has been refuted by evidence. They’re better described as cockroach ideas — false claims you may think you’ve gotten rid of, but keep coming back.

Anyway, the Trump administration and its allies — put on the defensive by yet another deadly climate change-enhanced hurricane and an ominous United Nations report — have been making all of these bad arguments over the past few days. I’d say it was a shocking spectacle, except that it’s hard to get shocked these days. But it was a reminder that we’re now ruled by people who are willing to endanger civilization for the sake of political expediency, not to mention increased profits for their fossil-fuel friends.

About those cockroaches: Details aside, the very multiplicity of climate-denial arguments — the deniers’ story keeps changing, but the bottom line that we should do nothing remains the same — is a sign that the opponents of climate action are arguing in bad faith. They aren’t seriously trying to engage with the reality of climate change or the economics of reduced emissions; their goal is to keep polluters free to pollute as long as possible, and they’ll grab onto anything serving that goal.

Progressive Activists, on the other hand, subscribe to a darkened Rousseauian worldview. People may be inherently good, but the hierarchical structures of society are awful. The structures of inequality and oppression have to be dismantled.

Ninety-one percent of Progressive Activists say sexual harassment is common, while only 12 percent of Devoted Conservatives agree. Ninety-two percent of Progressive Activists say people don’t take racism seriously enough, compared with 6 percent of Devoted Conservatives. Eighty-six percent of Progressive Activists say life’s outcomes are outside people’s control; only 2 percent of Devoted Conservatives agree. Progressive Activists are nearly three times as likely to say they are ashamed to be American as the average voter.

This philosophical dispute is not new. There have always been some people who thought we need hierarchical structures to keep us safe and others who thought we need to be emancipated from oppressive structures so we can be free.

What is new is how cultish this dispute has become. The researchers asked a wide variety of questions, on everything from child-rearing to national anthem protests. In many cases, 97 to 99 percent of Progressive Activists said one thing and 93 to 95 percent of Dedicated Conservatives said the opposite. There’s little evidence of individual thought, just cult conformity. The current situation really does begin to look like the religious wars that ripped through Europe after the invention of the printing press, except that our religions now wear pagan political garb.

The good news is that once you get outside these two elite groups you find a lot more independent thinking and flexibility. This is not a 50-50 nation. It only appears that way when disenchanted voters are forced to choose between the two extreme cults.

Roughly two-thirds of Americans, across four political types, fall into what the authors call “the exhausted majority.” Sixty-one percent say people they agree with need to listen and compromise more. Eighty percent say political correctness is a problem, and 82 percent say the same about hate speech.

Unfortunately, people in the exhausted majority have no narrative. They have no coherent philosophic worldview to organize their thinking and compel action. When they get one I suspect it will look totally unlike the two dominant narratives today. These narratives are threat narratives. But the people who make positive change usually focus on gifts, not deficits. They tell stories about the assets we have and how we can use them together.

I don’t know what the next political paradigm will look like, but I bet it will be based on abundance, not deficits; gifts, not fear; hope, not hatred.

But the people who make positive change usually focus on gifts, not deficits. They tell stories about the assets we have and how we can use them together.

I don’t know what the next political paradigm will look like, but I bet it will be based on abundance, not deficits; gifts, not fear; hope, not hatred.

Progressive Activists, on the other hand, subscribe to a darkened Rousseauian worldview. People may be inherently good, but the hierarchical structures of society are awful. The structures of inequality and oppression have to be dismantled.

Ninety-one percent of Progressive Activists say sexual harassment is common, while only 12 percent of Devoted Conservatives agree. Ninety-two percent of Progressive Activists say people don’t take racism seriously enough, compared with 6 percent of Devoted Conservatives. Eighty-six percent of Progressive Activists say life’s outcomes are outside people’s control; only 2 percent of Devoted Conservatives agree. Progressive Activists are nearly three times as likely to say they are ashamed to be American as the average voter.

This philosophical dispute is not new. There have always been some people who thought we need hierarchical structures to keep us safe and others who thought we need to be emancipated from oppressive structures so we can be free.

What is new is how cultish this dispute has become. The researchers asked a wide variety of questions, on everything from child-rearing to national anthem protests. In many cases, 97 to 99 percent of Progressive Activists said one thing and 93 to 95 percent of Dedicated Conservatives said the opposite. There’s little evidence of individual thought, just cult conformity. The current situation really does begin to look like the religious wars that ripped through Europe after the invention of the printing press, except that our religions now wear pagan political garb.

The good news is that once you get outside these two elite groups you find a lot more independent thinking and flexibility. This is not a 50-50 nation. It only appears that way when disenchanted voters are forced to choose between the two extreme cults.

Roughly two-thirds of Americans, across four political types, fall into what the authors call “the exhausted majority.” Sixty-one percent say people they agree with need to listen and compromise more. Eighty percent say political correctness is a problem, and 82 percent say the same about hate speech.

The report released recently by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change laid out the drastic reductions in coal, oil and gas consumption necessary to avoid catastrophic warming of the planet. But to stave off the most disastrous damage, we need to swear off another product, too: hydrofluorocarbons, better known as HFCs. And banishing them shouldn’t be so hard, relatively speaking.

In a bitter irony, these chemicals, used to cool, have also been driving global temperatures up. Used in refrigerators and air-conditioners since the 1980s, HFCs are extremely potent contributors to the earth’s warming. One HFC, 134a, used in most American refrigerators traps 1,300 times more heat than carbon dioxide does . Another, 410a, used in most American air-conditioners, is worse. Around the world, as more people rely on air-conditioning to cope with severe heat, the HFCs that routinely leak out of appliances and into the atmosphere have become the fastest-growing type of greenhouse gas emitted in every country on earth.

There is a seemingly simple solution to this feedback loop: Stop making and using HFCs. But so far, we’ve been unable to do it — not for scientific reasons, but for political ones. Just as we do with fossil fuels, we already have alternatives to HFCs that don’t contribute to warming. For cooling, a range of substances including ammonia, propane and iso-butane can do the trick.

Yet, instead of moving forward, our country has been reversing the steps it has already taken toward solving the HFC problem. This year, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would not be enforcing a 2015 rule that prohibited the use of HFCs. The E.P.A. has also proposed weakening an Obama-era effort to limit HFC leaks from appliances.

And Richard Sears reached them. He used his genius for advertising and promotion to put a catalog in the hands of 20 million Americans in 1900, when the population was 76 million. The Wish Book or Big Book or Dream Book, as the catalog was variously called, could run a staggering 1,500 pages and offer more than 100,000 items. And when one of his pants suppliers, the manufacturing wizard Julius Rosenwald, became his partner, in 1886, Sears was on the way to becoming a vertically integrated juggernaut. Whether you needed a cream separator or a catcher’s mitt, a plow or a dress, or an entire house, Sears had it. “No matter where you go or how long you look, you’ll not find values approaching those this book presents,” the spring 1922 catalog declared.

The company was not alone. A.&P., which introduced the first cut-rate grocery store in 1912, was also sliding into a long decline that would last through decades of ownership and management changes. Great A.&P. went through the final checkout lane in 2016 following its second bankruptcy. ( Or was that the third? ) A.&P. once operated 15, 819 stores and ran the world’s largest food packaging plant, in Horseheads, N.Y. The company was so powerful that in 1949 trustbusters tried to slice it into seven independent companies. Even before that, states passed “chain laws” that included minimum markups, so small stores couldn’t be undermined by the loss leaders that A.&P. would offer to attract shoppers. A.&P., a vicious competitor, buried local retailers anyway.

By the inflation-racked 1970s , though, A.&P. was struggling against nimbler chains such as Safeway, which became the country’s top grocer, and Kroger, as well as new models of retailing such as big-box stores . Walmart’s eventual move into groceries would help seal A.&P.’s fate, and, at the same time, make the Arkansas company the nation’s top retailer, where it remains. For now.

A.&P. would later show some dubious creativity when in the early 1980s management scrapped and replaced the “overfunded” pension plan, plundering it for operating capital. This piece of sliminess was copied all over corporate America, signaling the end of the pension plans that so many workers depended on for retirement income.

And Richard Sears reached them. He used his genius for advertising and promotion to put a catalog in the hands of 20 million Americans in 1900, when the population was 76 million. The Wish Book or Big Book or Dream Book, as the catalog was variously called, could run a staggering 1,500 pages and offer more than 100,000 items. And when one of his pants suppliers, the manufacturing wizard Julius Rosenwald, became his partner, in 1886, Sears was on the way to becoming a vertically integrated juggernaut. Whether you needed a cream separator or a catcher’s mitt, a plow or a dress, or an entire house, Sears had it. “No matter where you go or how long you look, you’ll not find values approaching those this book presents,” the spring 1922 catalog declared.

ORAN, Algeria — I was born eight years after the 1962 Algerian declaration of independence. I didn’t experience the war, but it was present in my imagination, through my parents, their friends and their discussions, and through the state: in school, on television, on national holidays and in official speeches. As for many people my age, everything I heard brought on saturation and then rejection.

When I was a child, one way to get people to laugh was to make fun of war veterans and their tendency to exaggerate or invent acts of bravery in the past in order to gain privileges in the present. As young as school-age, we could sense the lying. This intuition was reinforced by our parents, who told us about fake mujahideens — supposed former combatants — more and more of whom were claiming rights, and also by the spectacle of the injustices brought about by those rights: privileged access to housing and employment, tax exemptions, special social protections, among other things.

I was made to feel guilty for not having been born earlier and not having participated in the war. Indebted to those who fought France, I was ordered to revere my elders. So I’m part of the generation for whom the memory of the war in Algeria — and, according to our schoolbooks, its 1.5 million martyrs — is shrouded in suspicion. We grew up convinced that this story was no longer an epic, but about profits.

Today, the France of Emmanuel Macron — a president who, like me, has no experience of the war — has decided to recognize an important event: the torture and execution of Maurice Audin, a young French Communist, by the French Army during the Battle of Algiers in 1957.

We grew up convinced that this story was no longer an epic, but about profits.

Today, the France of Emmanuel Macron — a president who, like me, has no experience of the war — has decided to recognize an important event: the torture and execution of Maurice Audin, a young French Communist, by the French Army during the Battle of Algiers in 1957.

ORAN, Algeria — I was born eight years after the 1962 Algerian declaration of independence. I didn’t experience the war, but it was present in my imagination, through my parents, their friends and their discussions, and through the state: in school, on television, on national holidays and in official speeches. As for many people my age, everything I heard brought on saturation and then rejection.

When I was a child, one way to get people to laugh was to make fun of war veterans and their tendency to exaggerate or invent acts of bravery in the past in order to gain privileges in the present. As young as school-age, we could sense the lying. This intuition was reinforced by our parents, who told us about fake mujahideens — supposed former combatants — more and more of whom were claiming rights, and also by the spectacle of the injustices brought about by those rights: privileged access to housing and employment, tax exemptions, special social protections, among other things.

Ethnocentric views of “Asian pride” can be seductive for those who have historically felt disempowered. To acknowledge our collective anger and pain, how we are both targeted by racism from whites and perpetuators of racism against blacks and Latinos, may feel vulnerable and dangerous.

My family’s story is far from being the only kind of Asian-American story, though it’s the one that has largely been told, particularly in mainstream media. That’s partly because of who has access to that media and partly because it’s a story white Americans feel more comfortable with, because it still puts them at the center.

There are pitfalls to hearing — or investing in — only one type of story. Though the Asian-American population increased by 72 percent from 2000 to 2015 and is continuing to rise, on track to become the largest immigrant group in the United States by 2055, we’ve been here since the 18th century. We have been driven from towns, banned and interned; and we continue to be incarcerated, profiled, murdered and deported at alarming rates. The touted success of the model minority has not resulted in true political or cultural power. Asian-Americans remain scapegoats for economic anxieties, from the immigrants blamed for taking away good-paying jobs from white Americans to the Asian students blamed for taking college acceptance spots away from white students.

Asian-American, a political identity formed in the 1960s and consisting of Americans with roots in more than 20 countries, is a label that can be both empowering and exclusionary. Asian- America ns aren’t just East Asian, heterosexual and middle class. They’re queer and working class and poor and undocumented;South Asian and Southeast Asian and Filipino and Central Asian. A narrow definition of Asian-American does a disservice to all of us.

Asian America is changing. While new immigrants continue to expand our communities, so do the grandchildren of post-1965 immigrants, born to parents who were also born in the United States. Will these third-generation Asian-Americans be less concerned with the white gaze — with the guidance counselors and college admissions officers who refuse to see them fully — than previous generations have been?

Mari Matsuda wrote in 1996 about how important it is for Asian-Americans to resist becoming what she calls the racial bourgeoisie. We can choose, falsely, to believe that if we try hard enough, we’ll be accepted by whiteness and gain its privileges, at the expense of other people of color — the myth of exceptionalism. Or we can work to be in solidarity across racial, ethnic and class differences, to refuse to be used to uphold white supremacy.

By looking more closely at our history, at what we have gained and at what and whose expense, we can better inform our futures. Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley may be prominent Asian-American Republicans, but our political histories are shaped by activists like Larry Itliong, Grace Lee Boggs, Yuri Kochiyama and Pauline Park. Our Asian-American future is also informed by our present: all-Asian suburbias; multiethnic Chinatowns; success that’s less defined by Hollywood representation and the breaking of the corporate ceiling and more by pushing for equity for all Americans, not only a select few . As America moves away from whiteness as its norm, it’s crucial to imagine, and fulfill, our own radical futures.

Asian-Americans remain scapegoats for economic anxieties, from the immigrants blamed for taking away good-paying jobs from white Americans to the Asian students blamed for taking college acceptance spots away from white students.

Asian-American, a political identity formed in the 1960s and consisting of Americans with roots in more than 20 countries, is a label that can be both empowering and exclusionary. Asian- America ns aren’t just East Asian, heterosexual and middle class. They’re queer and working class and poor and undocumented;South Asian and Southeast Asian and Filipino and Central Asian. A narrow definition of Asian-American does a disservice to all of us.

Asian America is changing. While new immigrants continue to expand our communities, so do the grandchildren of post-1965 immigrants, born to parents who were also born in the United States. Will these third-generation Asian-Americans be less concerned with the white gaze — with the guidance counselors and college admissions officers who refuse to see them fully — than previous generations have been?

Mari Matsuda wrote in 1996 about how important it is for Asian-Americans to resist becoming what she calls the racial bourgeoisie. We can choose, falsely, to believe that if we try hard enough, we’ll be accepted by whiteness and gain its privileges, at the expense of other people of color — the myth of exceptionalism. Or we can work to be in solidarity across racial, ethnic and class differences, to refuse to be used to uphold white supremacy.

By looking more closely at our history, at what we have gained and at what and whose expense, we can better inform our futures. Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley may be prominent Asian-American Republicans, but our political histories are shaped by activists like Larry Itliong, Grace Lee Boggs, Yuri Kochiyama and Pauline Park. Our Asian-American future is also informed by our present: all-Asian suburbias; multiethnic Chinatowns; success that’s less defined by Hollywood representation and the breaking of the corporate ceiling and more by pushing for equity for all Americans, not only a select few . As America moves away from whiteness as its norm, it’s crucial to imagine, and fulfill, our own radical futures.

Ethnocentric views of “Asian pride” can be seductive for those who have historically felt disempowered. To acknowledge our collective anger and pain, how we are both targeted by racism from whites and perpetuators of racism against blacks and Latinos, may feel vulnerable and dangerous.

My family’s story is far from being the only kind of Asian-American story, though it’s the one that has largely been told, particularly in mainstream media. That’s partly because of who has access to that media and partly because it’s a story white Americans feel more comfortable with, because it still puts them at the center.

There are pitfalls to hearing — or investing in — only one type of story. Though the Asian-American population increased by 72 percent from 2000 to 2015 and is continuing to rise, on track to become the largest immigrant group in the United States by 2055, we’ve been here since the 18th century.

Jamal and I had many dreams, but the most important one was to build a home together. Sometimes he would talk about his friends in the United States and speak about how he would want me to meet them after our marriage. Almost every day he said he would wish to wake up in the morning knowing he was not alone. Despite dealing with such intense emotions, Jamal never bothered others with his problems. He always tried to remain as strong as a mountain.

He was cheerful the morning we were going to the Saudi consulate to get a document certifying his divorce. I decided not to go to my university that day, and we traveled there together. He had no foreboding of what was to come. The consular official, who had informed him that the paperwork had come through, had told him to be at the Saudi consulate at 1 p.m.

On our way there, we made plans for the rest of the day. We were going to browse appliances for our new home and meet with our friends and family members over dinner. When we arrived at the consulate, he went right in. He told me to alert the Turkish authorities if I did not hear from him soon. Had I known it would be the last time I would see Jamal, I would have rather entered the Saudi consulate myself. The rest is history: He never walked out of that building. And with him, I also got lost there.

Since then, I have been thinking that Jamal and I are no longer in the same world. I keep asking the same questions to myself: Where is he? Is he alive? If he is alive, how is he?

Today is Jamal’s birthday. I had planned a party, inviting his closest friends to surround him with the love and warmth that he had missed. We would have been married now.

Twelve days have passed. I have been waking up every morning hoping to hear from him. The speculations about his fate have not been confirmed by the authorities, but the silence of Saudi Arabia fills me with dread. That haunting question doesn’t leave me for a single moment: Is it true? Have they assassinated Jamal?

The next day, the offer came, with one change — no group insurance. Instead, I would receive $500 to buy my own policy. When I told him that could not work, he pressed me to explain. Reluctantly, I revealed my epilepsy. The next morning, on my first day of work, he told me that I was off salary and I was no longer allowed in the office. Less than 24 hours after I disclosed my epilepsy, the advocacy group decided I had to work as a freelancer from home. My chance for insurance evaporated.

Job after job followed, none with coverage. Months before my dreaded 25th birthday, I took a low-level editor’s post compiling career announcements for a Washington magazine; I hated the work, but I needed the health coverage. Weeks into the job, the insurer rejected a bill for my anticonvulsants; unknown to me until that moment, the magazine’s insurance policy included a pre-existing condition clause.

Desperate, I pleaded with colleagues for help. One journalist offered to assist me in gaining work as a copy boy at The New York Times — a job many rungs lower on the career ladder, but one that offered insurance. In my interview, a perplexed editor stared at my résumé. Why, he asked, would I trade an editor’s job for one fetching coffee?

I lied. I revealed nothing about my health issues or my fears of financial wreckage. Instead, I rhapsodized about The Times. I got the job.

I turned 25 before my Times policy went into effect, leaving me uninsured for a few weeks. During that gap, I found myself post-seizure in an emergency room. Realizing I was responsible for all the costs, I demanded to be released and staggered outside. I woke up hours later on the sidewalk. My parents paid the multi-thousand-dollar hospital bill out of pocket.

I worked seven days a week as a copy boy and then news clerk, terrified that easing up would cost me my job and my insurance. Thankfully, in 1988, The Times promoted me to reporter.

By 2005, I was married and considered going on my wife’s employer’s insurance plan so that I could become a full-time book writer . But my wife is four years older than me, and she hoped to retire at 65, when she aged into Medicare. If I was solely an author, at the age of 61 I would be both uninsured and uninsurable. I abandoned the idea.

Reluctantly, I revealed my epilepsy. The next morning, on my first day of work, he told me that I was off salary and I was no longer allowed in the office. Less than 24 hours after I disclosed my epilepsy, the advocacy group decided I had to work as a freelancer from home. My chance for insurance evaporated.

Chandler Fowles knew it wouldn’t be simple to move from Mystic, Conn., to New York City last year. But staying put held little appeal. Her degree in art history and fine arts from Eastern Connecticut State University wasn’t helping her land any job worth sticking around for. She was coming out of a tough breakup. She and her mother weren’t speaking at all after a particularly bad argument.

When you are 24 years old, jobless, boyfriend-less and in a fight with your mom, moving to one of the most glamorous, ballyhooed cities in the world can seem like a good idea. Never mind the expense.

Ms. Fowles arrived in August 2017. For all the excitement of moving to New York City, she ended up sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates across the Hudson River, in Jersey City, N.J. She got a retail job at a clothing store in Midtown that paid her $15 an hour and a commission of 1.5 percent of her sales. The cost of living (and partying) was more than she could manage, along with her $25,000 in college student loan debt.

When you are 24 years old, jobless, boyfriend-less and in a fight with your mom, moving to one of the most glamorous, ballyhooed cities in the world can seem like a good idea. Never mind the expense.

Ms. Fowles arrived in August 2017. For all the excitement of moving to New York City, she ended up sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates across the Hudson River, in Jersey City, N.J. She got a retail job at a clothing store in Midtown that paid her $15 an hour and a commission of 1.5 percent of her sales. The cost of living (and partying) was more than she could manage, along with her $25,000 in college student loan debt.

RUNGIS, France — Around midnight, as most Parisians head to sleep after a long day at work, a parallel universe rouses to life inside a giant food market — slightly larger than the size of Monaco — five miles south of the French capital.

In a refrigerated hall the length of a soccer field, Pascal Dufays wiped a layer of crushed ice off the silvery flank of a Saint-Pierre fish and pointed to its eyes. They were perfectly clear — a sign of freshness.

“See that beauty?” said Mr. Dufays, his breath forming clouds in the glacial air. “It was caught this morning in Brittany, by independent fishermen in small boats.”

When the activist Tarana Burke started the original Me Too movement more than a decade ago on MySpace, she never imagined what a force it would become. Then on Oct. 15, 2017, the actress Alyssa Milano shared on Twitter a friend’s suggestion that “women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted” write “Me too” in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein revelations earlier that month. The #MeToo hashtag instantly went viral. And Burke was thrust into the global spotlight.

In the year since the movement upended entertainment and politics, Burke has been working to ensure that Me Too doesn’t lose sight of its mission: to connect survivors of sexual assault to the resources they need in order to heal. To mark the one-year anniversary of #MeToo’s rise, Burke will unveil a number of new initiatives, including a series of public service announcements and a website intended as a hub for survivors. There is also a plan, in its early stages, to work with Hollywood writers rooms to address how they handle sexual abuse on the screen.

In a recent interview at a friend’s apartment in Manhattan, Burke discussed the future of the movement, the #HimToo backlash and the added complications facing black survivors. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

What will the new site look like?

The site is rolling out in phases: Phase 1 will have two resource libraries, one that’s specifically about finding healing resources, and one that’s about finding advocacy resources. So, if you want to find out who is doing stuff in your community, you can find it on the advocacy side. If you’re starting your healing journey, and you’re trying to find out information about how you can connect with other survivors in your community, or find a therapist, you can find it on the resource side.

ONE year ago Alyssa Milano, an American actress, posted on Twitter: “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.” Within 24 hours she had received more than 500,000 responses using the hashtag “#MeToo”. Ms Milano’s tweet came days after the New York Times and New Yorker had published detailed allegations of sexual harassment by Harvey Weinstein, a Hollywood producer. Mr Weinstein was the first in a long line of prominent entertainers and executives to be toppled by such investigations, which dominated the headlines throughout late 2017 (see chart below).

Even as these stories broke, it was #MeToo that resonated most on social media, as millions of women shared their experiences of abuse, intimidation and discrimination. In the past 12 months, the hashtag has been tweeted 18m times according to Keyhole, a social-media analytics company. The phrase has come to encapsulate the idea of sexual misconduct and assault. In recent months American journalists have used the hashtag in their articles more frequently than they have mentioned “sexual harassment”, according to Meltwater, a media analytics company.













Yet surveys suggest that this year-long storm of allegations, confessions and firings has actually made Americans more sceptical about sexual harassment. In the first week of November 2017, YouGov polled 1,500 Americans about their attitudes on the matter, on behalf of The Economist. In the final week of September 2018, it conducted a similar poll again. When it came to questions about the consequences of sexual assault and misconduct, there was a small but clear shift against victims.

The share of American adults responding that men who sexually harassed women at work 20 years ago should keep their jobs has risen from 28% to 36%. The proportion who think that women who complain about sexual harassment cause more problems than they solve has grown from 29% to 31%. And 18% of Americans now think that false accusations of sexual assault are a bigger problem than attacks that go unreported or unpunished, compared with 13% in November last year. (According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Centre, an American non-profit organisation, 63% of sexual assaults are not reported to police, whereas between 2% and 10% of assault cases are falsely reported.)

Surprisingly, these changes in opinion against victims have been slightly stronger among women than men. Rather than breaking along gendered lines, the #MeToo divide increasingly appears to be a partisan one. On each of these three questions, the gap between Trump and Clinton voters is at least six times greater than the one between genders.

IT WAS the sort of failure that rivets the world: two minutes into the launch of a Soyuz spacecraft from a site in Kazakhstan, the mission to the International Space Station (ISS) was aborted. Fortunately the two men on board, one each from Russia and America, were able to make a safe, if high-gravity, re-entry and landing. Dmitry Rogozin, the chief of Russia’s space agency (Roscosmos), and a canny politician himself, says crewed missions will remain on hold until an investigation reveals what went wrong. Given that the Russian Soyuz system is presently the only way to get people into orbit, this creates a situation that could leave the ISS empty from December. And America is powerless to do anything. How did it end up relying on Russian rocketry to gets its astronauts to the space station?

The answer dates back to the development of America’s Space Shuttle programme. It was conceived in the late 1960s as a way to give NASA a set of inexpensive and reusable spacecraft. In fact, by the time of the last shuttle mission, in 2011, America had ended up paying an average of $1.5bn per flight. NASA had expected to use the Constellation project to replace the shuttles for ISS missions by 2014, and later to fly astronauts to the moon. But it was cancelled in 2010 as costs ballooned. Seeking other options, the space agency has had some success in getting private firms such as SpaceX and Orbital ATK to deliver cargo to the ISS. And in 2014 it awarded contracts to both Boeing and SpaceX to develop craft to get astronauts there. The date at which those craft were due to be available for flight testing has slipped, though, to 2017, then 2018, and now April 2019 for SpaceX and mid-2019 for Boeing. The US General Accounting Office says 2020 is the earliest date it expects actual flights could reach the space station, assuming all continues to plan.

In contrast to the cost overruns and cancellations of the American programmes, Soyuz has been an unabashed success. Crewed flights started in 1967 with a fatality, but only one subsequent mission (Soyuz 11 in 1971) led to the loss of lives. Nearly 140 missions have been flown. The aborted flight on October 11th was only the fourth failure relating to launch or re-entry. A similarly designed cargo spacecraft, the Progress, has had over 150 uncrewed missions with just three failures. Russia’s willingness to ferry passengers—including space tourists—gave NASA and other agencies a useful fallback option while politicians mucked about with budgets and priorities, and paid for a meaningful portion of its annual space budget. The main difficulty for foreign astronauts using the Soyuz craft is that they must learn Russian to a good standard. But Russia said recently that its obligations to take American astronauts to the ISS would expire in April 2019. The statement’s finality owes much to the rather chilly state of relations between America and Russia. Back in 2014 Mr Rogozin became one of those Russians on whom America imposed sanctions. He tweeted shortly afterwards that NASA should deliver its astronauts to the ISS “with a trampoline”.

The investigation by Roscosmos into the recent failure will probably extend beyond December—the date by which the three astronauts presently on the ISS must use a Soyuz descent vehicle before its corrosive fuel renders the craft unusable. They must also worry about a now-patched hole in the descent craft that Mr Rogozin has suggested might be the result of sabotage. The crew have sufficient supplies to stay longer, but are likely to come back. Given that no manned flights to the ISS are imminent, NASA’s reliance on Soyuz could mean the station becomes “decrewed” in 2019. It can operate unattended for long periods. But there is a strong chance that no humans will reach it again until at least 2020. This could ultimately lead to the abandonment of the ISS even before 2025, when American funding is expected to run out.

BAVARIA’s conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) has spent the past months performing a sort of controlled experiment into the state of European politics today. In one of the wealthiest parts of Europe, where unemployment barely exists and the migration crisis of 2015 was handled remarkably well, the party that had governed for decades lurched far to the right over the past half-year. The CSU is the sister party of Angela Merkel’s more moderate Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which runs candidates in the other 15 German federal states but not Bavaria. Horst Seehofer, federal interior minister in the CDU/CSU’s coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), has spent the past months pushing Mrs Merkel’s government to the brink of collapse over migration and related issues. In Bavaria Markus Söder, his successor as state premier, has pursued a quasi-Trumpist strategy focused on the restoration of Bavaria’s “Christian” identity.

This strategy hit the buffers with a deafening crash today when Bavaria went to the polls in its five-yearly state election. Last time, in 2013, the CSU regained its majority in the state parliament after its first period in coalition since its rise to prominence in the 1950s. But with party leaders panicking after the CDU/CSU’s poor result in last September’s national election, at which the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) took third place, it attempted to emulate elements of the AfD’s strategy. Today it paid the price: its support falling from 48% in 2013 to 37% (according to the latest prognosis) as voters turned instead to the left-liberal Greens, the rightish-localist Free Voters (FW) and the AfD.

That was marginally better than the gloomiest polls had suggested but still abysmal by CSU standards. The first prognosis at 6pm local time had been even lower, the crowd at the CSU rally at the Bavarian state parliament in Munich standing silent, but for a few mutters, as it was read out on the giant screen before them. Shortly afterwards I ran into Mr Söder as he entered the building and asked if he felt relieved. He grimaced and said he needed to speak to colleagues. A while later, speaking before the CSU rally, he claimed a mandate to form a government—but appeared brow-beaten and chastened, acknowledging that the party needed to reflect on the result. Heads may yet roll in the CSU. Meanwhile the Green Party rally, also held within the magnificent Maximilianeum building in Munich housing the Bavarian parliament, was abuzz. The Greens—now in second-place nationally in several polls thanks to a newly pragmatic, centrist pitch that worked wonders in Bavaria today—feel they have the momentum.

What is the significance of tonight’s result? In Bavaria it may well mean a CSU-FW coalition and a change of personnel at the top of the CSU. Meanwhile, in Berlin, Mrs Merkel would be forgiven for feeling relieved. The CSU may be her CDU’s sister party but its tactics in recent months have made her job almost impossible. She will not mourn Mr Seehofer’s career if he is ousted in the coming days. Moreover, the CSU’s electoral meltdown will curb the enthusiasm of anti-Merkel conservatives in her own party who urged her to emulate the Söder-Seehofer playbook.

But tonight’s result also points to something broader. The CSU used to be the epitome of what Germans call “Volksparteien”, or “people’s parties”. These giant, big-tent, centre-right or centre-left forces used to have something approaching a monopoly on the politics of most Western European countries. But in most, that monopoly is disintegrating. The Gaullists and Socialists are losing their relevance in France while the far right, far left and radical centre surge. In the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Italy the old Christian democrats and socialists have been diminished by more vital forces on the right, left and centre. In Greece and Austria the centre-right stumbles on, but social democrats are in crisis. In Germany support for the CDU and the SPD is falling almost across the board (with a few intriguing regional exceptions), while the Greens and AfD are rising. Only in Britain are the two traditional parties still strong, but they only have their country’s profoundly distorting electoral system to thank.

The decline of the Volksparteien is fundamentally changing how Europe is run. In next year’s European election, both the European Parliament and the European Commission may become more fractious as the old duopoly of centre-right and centre-left loses its majority. At a national level, the old notion of big mainstream parties as clearing houses for differing outlooks and interests is giving way to something more tribal. Whatever you think of the CSU (and the similarly failing Bavarian SPD), recognise that their decline stands for something bigger: the end of an age of consensus and the dawn of a new age of intra-European antagonism.

ROMANIA’S monarchy has been defunct since 1947. But the royal family still enjoys much of the associated pageantry. It hosts events in the fairy-tale Peles Castle, once its home, now a museum. Two years ago the dynasty’s 150th anniversary was celebrated with substantial pomp: soldiers presenting arms, a regimental band, and aeroplanes leaving smoke trails in the national colours. Many Romanians still take an interest in royal affairs. Last December tens of thousands lined the streets of Bucharest to watch the spectacular state funeral given to the last king, Michael. Members of several foreign royal families attended. After King Michael’s death, the parliament discussed a bill to grant the head of the royal house the same status as that of former heads of state. It also toyed with the idea of a referendum on restoring the monarchy (a poll showed that some 70% of the public want the issue put to a popular vote), but never moved forward with it.

For many centuries Romanians were ruled by local princes, as well as by the Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires. In 1881 the newly united country’s parliament asked the ruling prince, a German named Carol Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, to be its first modern king. On his death his nephew, Ferdinand, inherited the throne. And when King Ferdinand died his five-year-old grandson, Michael, became king. The boy’s dissipated father, who had previously renounced his rights to the throne, returned to reclaim the crown in 1930 as King Carol II, but was forced out of the country again in 1940. Michael became king a second time, but abdicated seven years later under pressure from the communists, and spent the next four decades in Switzerland. He returned after the fall of the Ceausescu regime, but was never restored as head of state. His oldest daughter, Margareta, is the current “Custodian of the Romanian Crown”.

Many Romanians are nostalgic about their short-lived royal dynasty. At King Michael’s funeral, shouts of “down with communism” alluded to the king’s opposing of communism in the 1940s. Spreading support for the royals may be linked to growing disgust at the corruption scandals besetting Romanian politics. In 2017 after the newly elected Social Democrats sought to decriminalise certain acts of corruption by officials, Romanians responded with the largest protests since the anti-communist revolution of 1989. This summer demonstrations returned over low wages and entrenched corruption. The National Alliance for the Restoration of the Monarchy, a youth organisation, optimistically uses the slogan “the monarchy will save Romania”.

The family itself, however, looks unlikely to play a central role in any royal revival. Much of its press coverage focuses on the interminable squabble over the line of succession. And there is much to squabble over. The throne may be defunct, but the royal family’s fortune is still put at €65m ($73m), as of 2017, including four castles and 20,000 hectares of forest. In 2015 Michael denied Nicholas Medforth-Mills, the son of his second daughter, his title and dynastic rights for allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock (he denies this). And the self-styled “Prince Paul of Romania” has repeatedly tried to take Michael to court over his dynastic rights as grandson of Carol II from a morganatic marriage (ie, to a woman of lower social rank, preventing the passing on of a title). In 2011 tabloids in Romania and Britain shared speculation that Charles, Prince of Wales, could become king, thanks to ancestry shared with Vlad the Impaler (the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s Dracula). Today’s royal claimants, it seems, may not get their teeth into the task of ruling.

MORE than 300m people suffer from depression around the world, and another 260m people suffer from anxiety. Technology and the constant cacophony of modern life are cited as the main causes of the increasing prevalence of mental illness.

After falling into depression aged 24, Matt Haig, a British writer, has used the experience to write about mental health. “Reasons to Stay Alive”, published in 2015, was his story of trying to cope with mental illness. His latest book, “Notes on a Nervous Planet”, focuses on overcoming anxiety, notably the angst from the constant stream of social media.

Mr Haig examines modern assaults on mental health with personal anecdotes and lists of ways to stay sane. The Economist’s Open Future initiative asked him questions about how the world should respond to the new mental-health crisis. His replies are followed by an excerpt from the book.

* * *

The Economist: More than 260m people experienced an anxiety disorder in 2016. Is the prevalence of anxiety getting worse or is the world simply more aware of mental health?

Matt Haig: People think that the anxiety figures and statistics should be slightly mistrusted because of the conversation we are now having about mental health. People feel more comfortable talking about it, so it might be the case that people are more aware of it. I would feel much more comfortable talking about it now than 20 years ago. But if you really break down the statistics, the sharpest rises in the last decade are in areas that are still heavily stigmatised, like eating disorders, personality disorders and self-harm. NHS admissions for eating disorders in the last decade have doubled. There are also specific problems related to contemporary society. Various aspects of modern life have an effect on mental health: social-media addiction, tech use, even walking around a shopping centre.

The Economist: What role does technology play in creating a more anxious society?

Mr Haig: No one would be able to deny that we’re in a period of profound change, even in the last ten years. People are living differently, meeting people differently, communicating with their friends in a different way, going outside less, sleeping differently. All these fundamental things are slightly changing because of technology. Change itself is unsettling—we know this on a personal level. Technology has always been behind that shift in human development.

Ultimately we feel the need for some sense of responsibility from social-media companies, and other companies. I wouldn’t want to tell anyone not to eat fast food or ice cream, but we all understand that if we sat in bed for six hours eating ice cream non-stop on a Saturday, that would probably have some health consequences.

It is not the technology itself that is the problem. It is our lack of awareness about how it is changing our lives and affecting our minds. We can’t put the genie back in the bottle even if we wanted to. The next stage is becoming a little bit more aware of how it affects us.

The Economist: Many people are aware that social media plays a role in exacerbating depression and anxiety—so what keeps people tethered?

Mr Haig: New data says that young people aged 16 to 24 are the loneliest generation and yet they’re the most connected there has ever been. Social media is definitely contributing to loneliness, but it also creates that craving for connection through social media at the same time. With social media there’s never any sense of satisfaction or completion. You always want more of it, but it never gives you what you want.

I definitely fall into that trap. Each social-media company has its own toxic issues. Twitter has trolling and political polarisation. Instagram’s problems are to do with self-esteem, body image and comparing yourself to other people. Snapchat is bad for teenagers who might feel insecure about their friendships and it has issues with online bullying.

The Economist: Aside from technology, what are the other ways in which modern society affects mental health?

Mr Haig: We seem to be less happy with what we have. We have solved so many problems, yet we are creating new ones at a faster rate. For most of us in the developed world, we have running water and a roof over our head. Yet paradoxically, we are the most stressed that we have ever been, and as anxious as we’ve ever been.

There are a lot of problems with consumer culture and our levels of happiness. The advertising industry tries to make us feel a lack, or anxious about something, using “FUD”—which stands for fear, uncertainty and doubt. Anti-ageing cream capitalises on the fear of looking like you’re ageing. Our fears are being exploited all the time.

We are constantly shifting our own goal posts. We are heading more and more into a work culture. We are either stressed because we desperately want to work or stressed that we need to be working harder to get the promotion. Our weekends are shrinking. The work-life balance is becoming blurred. We’re running out of mental space where we can be independent of our role in the economy.

The Economist: How can the mental-health crisis be solved? Does the government have a role, or is it up to society and the individual?

Mr Haig: At the moment we are heading in the wrong direction. In some cases, quite fast. I think if there is a solution, it is to tackle it at the root—among young people and work upward. Education needs looking at: half of all life-long mental-health conditions and illnesses originate in people aged 14 or under. Every day, I hear from so many parents of young teenagers who are having all kinds of crises, whether it’s to do with social-media bullying, panic attacks or their kids being stressed about endless exams.

Mental health needs to be taken seriously in employment. Campaigns for every workplace to provide a mental-health first-aider might sound like a gimmick or a token, but it is an important signal that makes people feel like mental health is something that they can legitimately talk about to the employers.

The mental health crisis is partly a crisis of meaning because the way we work is changing with the influx of computing and AI that can do what humans can do. We are facing a philosophical question. We need to see everything through the prism of mental health rather than the prism of just economics, employment figures or GCSE grades.

Excerpt from “Notes on a Nervous Planet” (Canongate, 2018), by Matt Haig

A problem in your pocket

While writing this book, early in 2018, I was asked by The Observer to contribute to an article where lots of writers asked the novelist and essayist Zadie Smith questions. I took the opportunity, not least because I had seen Zadie Smith at a couple of literary parties when I was newly published and had been crippled and mute with anxiety and hadn’t dared to go over and talk to her.

I had read about her social media scepticism and how she values her ‘right to be wrong’, and so I asked her, ‘Do you worry about what social media is doing to society?’

She didn’t mince her words, and started with a critique of smartphones.

‘I can’t stand the phones and don’t want them in my life in any form. They make me feel anxious, depressed, dead inside, unhinged. But I fully support anyone who finds them delightful and a profound asset to their existence.’

Although a self-described ‘Luddite abstainer’, Smith does think the time is right to look at how we’re using this technology. ‘What is this little device in your pocket doing to your intimate relationships with others?’ she asked. ‘To your behaviour as a citizen within a society? Maybe nothing! Maybe it’s all totally cool. But maybe not? . . . Do we need it resting by our pillows at night? Do our seven year- olds need phones? Do we wish to pass down our own dependency and obsession? It all has to be thought through. We can’t just let the tech companies decide for us.’

I use my phone a lot more than Smith does but despite that – or maybe because of it – I share a lot of her anxieties. And there are signs that even those working for the tech companies are concerned, which means we should be even more worried about where those stupendously powerful companies are leading us. For instance, it’s been known—at least since The New York Times reported it in 2011—that many Apple and Yahoo! employees choose to send their kids to schools which shun technology, such as the Waldorf School of the Peninsula in Los Altos.

There are also many tech insiders who have come out to warn against the things they have had a hand in creating. There was the guy who invented the ‘Like’ button on Facebook, Justin Rosenstein, who has said that technology is so addictive his phone has a parent-control feature to stop him downloading apps and restrict his use of social media. And, as a side point, it is worth mentioning that the Facebook ‘like’ function is also what helps the data miners understand who we are. Our online likes reveal everything from our sexual orientation to our politics, and can be harvested to better influence us, as seen in the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, where reports suggested 50 million Facebook members had their data improperly accessed by the British firm that helps businesses and political groups ‘change audience behaviour’.

‘It is very common,’ Rosenstein told The Guardian in 2017, like a latter-day Dr Frankenstein, ‘for humans to develop things with the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative consequences . . . Everyone is distracted, all the time.’

And two of Twitter’s founders have expressed similar regrets. Ev Williams—who stepped down as CEO in 2010—told The New York Times in 2017 that he was unhappy with the way Twitter had helped Donald Trump become president. ‘It’s a very bad thing, Twitter’s role in that.’

Another Twitter co-founder Biz Stone has other regrets. He stated in an interview with Inc. that he thought the big wrong turn Twitter made was when it allowed strangers to tag people in their posts, as it created an environment rife for bullying. Another employee, according to Buzzfeed, has called Twitter a ‘honeypot for assholes’.

And, in early 2018, Tim Cook—CEO of Apple—declared to a group of students in Essex, England, that he doesn’t think children (such as his nephew) should use a social network, or overuse technology at all, which shows that these aren’t simply ‘Luddite’ concerns.

Indeed, a group of former tech employees have gone further, and set up the Center for Humane Technology, aimed at ‘realigning technology with humanity’s best interests’ and reversing the ‘digital attention crisis’.

Now, at long last, there are many instances of tech people getting together to discuss concerns. For instance, at a 2018 conference in Washington called Truth About Tech, speakers included Google’s former ‘ethicist’ and now prominent tech whistleblower Tristan Harris and early investor of Facebook Roger McNamee, along with politicians and members of lobby groups such as Common Sense Media, who are trying to combat tech addiction in young people. A variety of concerns were raised, such as the way Google’s Gmail ‘hijacks’ minds, or how Snapchat exploits teenage friendships to fuel tech addiction via functions like ‘Snapchat streaks’ where users can see how many interactions they’ve had with friends per day. According to The Guardian, Harris compared the tech world to the Wild West in that the ethos is ‘build a casino wherever you want’ and McNamee compared it to the tobacco and food industries in the past, where cigarettes were promoted as healthy, or where manufacturers of ready meals failed to mention their products were loaded with salt. The difference being that with, say, an addiction to cigarettes, is that the cigarettes had no information about us. They didn’t collect our data. They couldn’t know us better than our own families. The internet, of course, can know everything about us. It can know who our friends are, it can know our taste in music, it can know our health concerns, our love life, and our politics – and internet companies can keep using this information to make their products ever more addictive. And at the moment, warn the tech insiders, there isn’t much regulation to stop them.

An increasing amount of research reinforces their concerns. For example, studies that show how technology contributes to a state of ‘continual partial attention’ and how it can be addictive. One 2017 study from the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas concluded that the mere presence of your smartphone can reduce ‘cognitive capacity’.

At the time of writing, there is still no official recognition that ‘smartphone addiction’ or ‘social media addiction’ are psychological disorders, although the fact that the World Health Organization now classifies video game addiction as an official mental disorder suggests that there is a growing understanding of how seriously technology can affect our mental health. But that understanding still has a long way to go, and clearly lags behind the disorientating speed of technological change.

Though pressure is rising. In 2018, for instance, CNN reported that the mighty Unilever threatened to pull its advertising from Facebook and Google unless they combat toxic problems – including privacy concerns, objectionable content and a lack of protections for children – which are ‘eroding social trust, harming users and undermining democracies’. There is a growing awareness that the great power of internet companies must come, Spiderman-style, with a great sense of responsibility. However, it is debatable as to how much responsibility they will develop without real social and financial pressure of the kind we are only beginning to see. As with fast food or cigarettes or the gun industry, the companies making a profit from something might be the most reluctant to see the potential problems. So when the people on the inside are among those raising the alarm, we should really listen.

WHILE Donald Trump’s policies on the international flow of goods, services and people have oscillated between cosmetic and consequential, his speeches about globalisation have carried a consistent message. America, he says, suffers from unfair trade deals and unproductive immigrants, both of which take jobs from Americans and weaken the economy. It is often assumed that Mr Trump is tapping into a broad-based backlash against globalisation with this rhetoric. But research suggests the opposite: trade and immigration are at a peak of popularity.

The Pew Research Centre has polled Americans on their opinions about growing trade and business ties with other countries since 2002. The proportion suggesting such ties were very good has never been higher than in 2018, and the proportion suggesting they were either somewhat or very good, at 74%, was only surpassed in 2002. Gallup, meanwhile, has asked if trade is primarily an opportunity for economic growth or a threat to the economy since 1992. Before 2015, the proportion suggesting it was primarily an opportunity had never risen above 56%. It reached 72% in 2017 and was still at 70% percent in February 2018.

Gallup has also asked Americans if immigration should be increased, decreased or kept at the present level since 1965. The proportion that wants to see immigration increase has never been higher, nor has the proportion calling for a decrease been lower. Over two-thirds of Americans polled in June 2018 wanted to keep immigration at its current level or increase it. Asked if immigrants mostly helped or mostly harm the economy, the majority of those who offered an opinion in 2017 thought that immigrants mostly helped. This was the first and only time that the positive view has been in the majority since the question was first asked in 1993.

Increasing partisanship might be expected to have affected opinions on globalisation. On that, the evidence is mixed. Surveys suggest little difference between Republicans and Democrats in their views regarding foreign trade in general—Republicans have traditionally been strongly in favor of the idea it strengthens the economy and Democrats have increasingly agreed. But on immigration, party partisans began to diverge a decade ago. In 2006, Republicans and Democrats were broadly indistinguishable on their views as to whether immigrants strengthened or weakened the country, but since then Democrats have become considerably more pro-immigration while Republicans have become marginally more opposed.

The role of partisanship on views of particular policies is more pronounced. In 2009, Republican voters backed free-trade agreements with greater fervor than Democrats, but that support collapsed in 2016. While Pew polling in July this year suggested that 49% of all Americans thought increased tariffs would be bad for the country compared to 40% who thought they would be good, the considerable majority of Republicans backed tariff increases.

The closer a survey question approaches specific policies, the more survey answers are likely to be driven by partisan loyalties. But the answers to more general questions about globalisation do not come close to suggesting that most Americans have turned towards economic isolationism—if anything, the reverse. The policy backlash against globalisation in America is not based on a popular revolt; rather, it is pandering to a dwindling minority.
